This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and follows a tic tac toe tutorial on https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.



## TODO: beyond the tutorial
* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* ~~Rewrite Board to use loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.~~
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
* break up the components so things are more readable (probably requires webpack)

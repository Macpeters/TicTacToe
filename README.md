This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and follows a tic tac toe tutorial on https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

## TODO: beyond the tutorial
* ~~Rewrite Board to use loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.~~
* ~~break up the components so things are more readable (probably requires webpack)~~
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
